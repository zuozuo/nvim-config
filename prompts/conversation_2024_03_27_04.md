what is the max columns clickhouse support

------------------------------

ClickHouse does not have a fixed limit on the maximum number of columns it can support. The number of columns that can be created in a table depends on various factors such as the available system resources, the size of the data, and the complexity of the queries. However, it is generally recommended to keep the number of columns in a table to a reasonable limit for better performance and manageability.
