please help to explain the code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
# The function to be traced.
@tf.function
def my_func(x, y):
  # A simple hand-rolled layer.
  return tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(x, y))

# Set up logging.
logdir = './logs/func'
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer(logdir)

# Sample data for your function.
x = tf.random.uniform((3, 3))
y = tf.random.uniform((3, 3))

# Bracket the function call with
# tf.summary.trace_on() and tf.summary.trace_export().
tf.summary.trace_on(graph=True, profiler=True)
# Call only one tf.function when tracing.
z = my_func(x, y)
with writer.as_default():
  tf.summary.trace_export(
      name="my_func_trace",
      step=0,
      profiler_outdir=logdir)
```


------------------------------

This code demonstrates how to trace and export a TensorFlow function using the `tf.summary.trace_on()` and `tf.summary.trace_export()` functions.

1. The code begins by importing the TensorFlow library.

2. The `my_func` function is defined and decorated with `@tf.function`. This decorator converts the Python function into a TensorFlow graph function, allowing it to be traced and optimized by TensorFlow.

3. Inside the `my_func` function, a simple hand-rolled layer is implemented using the `tf.nn.relu` and `tf.matmul` functions.

4. The `logdir` variable is set to the directory where the trace logs will be saved.

5. A `tf.summary.create_file_writer` object is created to write the trace logs to the specified directory.

6. Sample data `x` and `y` are generated using the `tf.random.uniform` function.

7. The tracing is enabled by calling `tf.summary.trace_on(graph=True, profiler=True)`. The `graph=True` argument indicates that the trace should include the TensorFlow graph structure, and the `profiler=True` argument enables profiling information to be included in the trace.

8. The `my_func` is called with the sample data `x` and `y`, and the result is stored in the `z` variable.

9. The trace logs are exported using `tf.summary.trace_export`. The `name` argument specifies the name of the trace, the `step` argument indicates the step number of the trace (useful for tracking the progress of training), and the `profiler_outdir` argument specifies the directory where the trace logs will be saved.

10. Finally, the trace logs are written to the file using the `writer.as_default()` context manager.

By running this code, a trace log file named "my_func_trace" will be created in the specified log directory. This trace log file contains the TensorFlow graph structure and profiling information for the traced function.

please help to write a python script, below is the requirements:
1. use tensorflow2.0 version
2. define a simple computation graph, to implement vector addition
3. generate a log writer, and write the current tensorflow graph to logs.

------------------------------

Sure! Here's a Python script that meets your requirements:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the computation graph
a = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])
b = tf.constant([4, 5, 6])
c = tf.add(a, b)

# Generate a log writer
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs')

# Write the current TensorFlow graph to logs
with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.trace_on(graph=True)
    tf.summary.trace_export(name="graph_trace", step=0)

# Run the computation graph
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(c)
    print(result)
```

Make sure you have TensorFlow 2.0 installed before running this script. It defines a simple computation graph that adds two vectors together (`a` and `b`). It then generates a log writer using `tf.summary.create_file_writer` and writes the current TensorFlow graph to logs using `tf.summary.trace_on` and `tf.summary.trace_export`. Finally, it runs the computation graph using a TensorFlow session and prints the result.

You can run this script and check the `logs` directory for the generated log file.

====================================================================================================

please help to update this code, the problem is there is no graph available in Tensorboard

```python
## tensorflow version 2.0
import tensorflow as tf

# Generate a log writer
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs/add_nn')

input1 = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], name="input1")
input2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.uniform([3]), name="input2")
output = tf.add_n([input1, input2], name="add")
```

------------------------------

To visualize the graph in TensorBoard, you need to use the `tf.summary` API to write the graph to the log file. Here's an updated version of your code that includes the necessary changes:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Generate a log writer
writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./logs/add_nn')

input1 = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], name="input1")
input2 = tf.Variable(tf.random.uniform([3]), name="input2")
output = tf.add_n([input1, input2], name="add")

# Write the graph to the log file
with writer.as_default():
    tf.summary.trace_on(graph=True)
    tf.summary.trace_export(name="graph_trace", step=0)

# Run the code to generate the log file
tf.summary.scalar("output", output, step=0)

# Close the writer
writer.close()
```

After running this code, you should see a log file named `events.out.tfevents.xxxxxx` in the `./logs/add_nn` directory. You can then launch TensorBoard and point it to the log directory to visualize the graph:

```
tensorboard --logdir=./logs/add_nn
```

Once TensorBoard is running, you can navigate to the "Graphs" tab to see the graph visualization.
