what is tensorbaord histograms

------------------------------

TensorBoard histograms are a visualization tool provided by TensorFlow for analyzing the distribution of values in tensors over time. It allows users to track and visualize the changes in the distribution of tensor values during the training process.

Histograms in TensorBoard provide a way to understand how the values of tensors are changing over time. They display the distribution of values in a tensor as a histogram, with the x-axis representing the value range and the y-axis representing the frequency or count of values falling within each bin.

By visualizing histograms, users can gain insights into the behavior of their models during training. They can identify if the values are converging or diverging, if there are any outliers, or if the distribution is shifting over time. This information can be useful for debugging and optimizing models.

TensorBoard histograms can be used to analyze the distribution of various tensors, such as weights, biases, gradients, or any other intermediate tensors in the model. They provide a visual representation of the statistical properties of these tensors, helping users understand how their models are learning and evolving.
